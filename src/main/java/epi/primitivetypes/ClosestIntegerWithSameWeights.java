 * weight of number 9 is 2 since there are 2 1's
 * closest number is number with same number of 1's such that |x - y| is a min as possible
 * 9 = 0001 0001
 * closest will be 0001 0010 in this case.
 * if the number is 0011
 * closest will be 0101
 * if the first 1 has a zero beside it, swap those bits
 * else find the first 1 that has a zero left to it and swap bits
